          <p>Hey there, my name is Iliana and I am a finance guru 💲, mother 🤰🏽, and geekdom enthusiast  🧝‍♀️. Currently I work as a Financial Assistant at Northwestern University where I specialize in student graduate funding and managing faculty grant portfolios.I am a graduate 👩🏽‍🎓 of the University of Illinois at Chicago and Northwestern University.</p>
    
          <p>My personal interests include collecting anything with Hello Kitty on it, cosplaying at Comic Conventions and traveling ✈️ the world. I have been to 10 countries so far. I believe that traveling the world gives one a different perspective and humbles oneself.</p>
    
          <p>I am currently attending the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp where I hope to gain skills to design websites 💻. Coding has been a long interest of mine and I am excited for the opportunity to be a part of this program.</p>
